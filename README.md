# MAT_311-AI-Assignment

**Overview**

The data in this notebook was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhanushnarayananr/credit-card-fraud/data. The goal was to recreate an existing notebookâ€™s data analysis on credit card fraud using a Large-Language Model AI. Various prompts were given to ChatGPT-4 to explore the data and create the visualizations. 

**Reflection**

By utilizing AI to help make the notebook, I was able to create the visualizations and write the code much faster. It was helpful when I forgot how to make a certain graph or the syntax of a certain library. I was able to explain what I wanted the graph to look like, and it generated the code for me. If I was getting an error, it also helped to debug the code and correct it. After I generated each visualization, I had to verify the output for correctness. In this case, it was much easier since I had an existing notebook to refer to. As I mentioned earlier, I got some errors with the generated code. Sometimes it would get confused on the variable names or labels so it was important to make sure they were consistent. 

Some dangers I can see for someone using AI to make this notebook without learning data science properly is simply putting too much trust in the AI. Because I had knowledge of data science, I was able to feed it prompts with more keywords and be more specific to the task I wanted to complete. Without this knowledge, it can be easy to create a graph and look good, but not know what is going on behind the graph. For example, the never-fraud model showed a high accuracy, but the model was biased. In this case, the model should not be used. I also learned that the generated code is only as good as the prompt. Slight changes to the wording can yield very different solutions. There is also danger if the data has not been properly cleaned.
